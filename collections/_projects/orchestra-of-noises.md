Workshop on sound experimentation, DIY instrument making and music co-creation.
Musical Yards, Ikaria (GR), 2021.

In this workshop we explore the latent sound potential of materials, objects and spaces in search of music in the everyday life and the environment.
We focus on their characteristics and how they can define musical ways of interacting, by creating original compositions through experimentation and improvisation.
We listen to the sound in space, visit places with special acoustic features and create site specific sound performances. We explore collective ways of composing and performing through graphic and verbal scores, conduction, rule-based systems and works of pioneering composers.
We complete the workshop with a public sound action presenting the ideas, instruments and sounds we discovered.
