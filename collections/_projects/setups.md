The project Zap! was born at the Orchestra of Noises sound experimentation and DIY instrument making workshop we conducted last summer in Ikaria, Greece. It is an attempt to display and materialise the invisible and inaudible fields of the electromagnetic spectrum. By using custom built induction coils, changes in the electromagnetic field can be translated into electric signals and thus into sound. This process is uncovering a hidden hertzian landscape allowing us to discover the sonic world of electromagnetic fields, surrounding our every step. Listening to the shrieks and squeals of everyday electric and electronic devices (transformers, phones, chargers, wifi routers, computers, etc.) not only makes us aware of our voiceless yet omnipresent electrical environment, but also intrigues us with the musical potential of this process. Approaching electronic devices and induction coils as musical instruments, we intend to expand our musical vocabulary and challenge ourselves by engaging with new ways of composing and improvising.
