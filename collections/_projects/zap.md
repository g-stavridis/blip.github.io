The ongoing project Zap! is an attempt to display and materialise the invisible and inaudible fields of the electromagnetic spectrum. By using custom built induction coils, changes in the electromagnetic field can be translated into electric signals and thus into sound. This process is uncovering a hidden hertzian landscape allowing us to discover the sonic world of electromagnetic fields, surrounding our every step. Listening to the shrieks and squeals of everyday electric and electronic devices (transformers, phones, chargers, wifi routers, computers, etc.) not only makes us aware of our voiceless yet omnipresent electrical environment, but also intrigues us with the musical potential of this process. Approaching electronic devices and induction coils as musical instruments, we intend to enhance our perception on electromagnetic emissions as well as to expand our listening boundaries and challenge ourselves by engaging with new ways of composing and improvising. Zap! has been presented in both performance and installation settings. Part of the project was developed at [GMEA - Centre National de Cr√©ation Musicale d'Albi - Tarn.](https://www.gmea.net/){:target="_blank"}
