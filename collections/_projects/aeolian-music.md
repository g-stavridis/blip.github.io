Long strings of various materials are attached to the metal structure of Pezi water dam's bridge, so when the north wind blows, the instrument comes to life. It is both an instrument and a musical composition; walking until the end of the bridge takes around 5 minutes, during which somebody might perceive an evolving musical composition and alternating sounds resulting from the use of different materials in different parts of the bridge. The project started during the Orchestra of Noises 2021 workshop in Musical Yards, Ikaria and further developed by Y.Stenos & Y.Stavridis in 2021-22.
