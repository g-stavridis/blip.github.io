In SETUPS, we bring in our solo setups in a contrasting, exploratory live set. Home-brewed electroacoustic micropercussion, electronics and amplified objects by Yorgos Stenos and 
diverted percussion instruments, objects and microphones by Yorgos Stavridis. Electronic and acoustic, hi-fi and lo-fi, combinations of textures, loops, rhythms, noise, microsounds, serene drones, all as interchangeable sound-blocks in cut-up like structures and immersive, improvisatory time holes.
