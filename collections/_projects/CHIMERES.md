<!-- Semi-autonomous instrumental installments consisting of objects, circuits and electronic media are scattered throughout the performance space, creating a dynamic sonic field of forces, each with its own attractors generating their own trajectories.  
The performers are present, improvising with the materials, activating or interrupting processes of sound production, playing with feedback, listening or silencing.  
Sound reveals space while space is becoming sound.  
The audience is invited to observe, listen, experience and engage with the performance on different levels and points of view. -->

A sonic playground where various personal attractions collide: Found objects, self-made constructions, percussion outbursts, raw electronics, acoustic phenomena, experiments with physics laws and material properties.  
Sound sources are scattered throughout the space, where the performers move around activating or interrupting processes, playing, listening or silencing. Each iteration of the project is distinct, shaped according to the characteristics of the space and the resources available.

*Chimeres* is commissioned by [SUBSET Festival](https://aefestival.gr/subset-festival-2025-festival-neas-moysikis/?lang=en){:target="_blank"} as part of the Athens Epidaurus Festival and will premiere in June 2025 at the Athens Conservatoire.
