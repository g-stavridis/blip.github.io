Long strings of various materials are attached to the metal structure of Pezi water dam's bridge, so when the north wind blows, the instrument comes to life. It is both an instrument and a musical composition; walking until the end of the bridge takes around 5 minutes, during which somebody might perceive an evolving musical composition and alternating sounds resulting from the use of different materials in different parts of the bridge. The project started during the Orchestra of Noises 2021 workshop in Musical Yards, Ikaria and further developed by Y.Stenos & Y.Stavridis in 2021-22.

- location: Pezi water dam, Raches, island of Ikaria, Greece -location coordinates: 37.57415312230255, 26.059170485754507

<!-- 
- During summer the wind is more suitable (July-August) and environmental conditions more friendly for a walk. Spring is usually ok as well.

- During night the wind calms down and it’s normally silent. Otherwise access to the place is 24/24, it’s an outdoor public space, easily approached by car, close to the village of Christos, Raches.
