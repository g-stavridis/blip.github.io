Semi-autonomous instrumental installments consisting of objects, circuits and electronic media are scattered throughout the performance space, creating a dynamic sonic field of forces, each with its own attractors generating their own trajectories.  
The performers are present, improvising with the materials, activating or interrupting processes of sound production, playing with feedback, listening or silencing.  
Sound reveals space while space is becoming sound.  
The audience is invited to observe, listen, experience and engage with the performance on different levels and points of view.
